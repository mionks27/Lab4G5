## What you should know  ‚öôÔ∏è

_After you register/login and are answering a question, select one random option and then select again the option your want so it will work. If you try to select an option, the first time won't work. _
_Do not use the "back" button from your device. I mean, just use the buttons that are on the project to navigate. _
